## Specifics

- `container.rs::format_docker_progress` is shared by `docker pull` and `docker compose up -d/down/pull/stop/start/restart`: it runs `core::passthrough::compact` first (ANSI, `\r` redraws, duplicate lines), folds `<layer>: Pull complete` / `Already exists` into counts, drops `Digest:` and the trailing image ref, and keeps only the final state of each compose resource. `compose up` without `-d`/`--detach` is passed through because it attaches to service logs

- `aws_cmd.rs` — 25 specialized filters covering STS, S3, EC2, ECS, RDS, CloudFormation, CloudWatch Logs, Lambda, IAM, DynamoDB, EKS, SQS, Secrets Manager. Forces `--output json` for structured parsing, uses `force_tee_hint()` for truncation recovery, strips Lambda secrets. Shared runner `run_aws_filtered()` handles boilerplate for JSON-based filters; text-based filters (S3 ls, S3 sync/cp) have dedicated runners
- `container.rs` handles Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift; `DockerCommands`, `KubectlCommands`, and `OcCommands` sub-enums in `main.rs` route to `container::run()` -- uses passthrough for unknown subcommands
- `curl_cmd.rs` truncates long responses, saves full output to file for recovery
- `wget_cmd.rs` wraps wget with output filtering
- `psql_cmd.rs` filters PostgreSQL query output
